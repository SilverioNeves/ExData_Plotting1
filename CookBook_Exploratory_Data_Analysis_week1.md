> Dataset Electric Power Consumption

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption

> DataSet Description

Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

> Variables

* __Date__: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
* __Time__: time in format hh:mm:ss
* __Global_active_power__: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
* __Global_reactive_power__: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
* __Voltage__: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
* __Global_intensity__: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
* __Sub_metering_1__: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
* __Sub_metering_2__: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
* __Sub_metering_3__: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
